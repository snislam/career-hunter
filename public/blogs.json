        "question": "Authentication vs Authorization.",
        "answer": "Authentication is system by which you are tested to check validity. If you are an existing user or not. If yes, then password are matched or not. If all are okay then you can access. On the other hand, authorization is the checking station about your power or which data can you use or access. So the basic difference is authentication check user credential check and authorization check the user role."
